    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Chicken katsu is Japanese-style fried chicken.</p>
    <p>This is my family recipe and can also be used to make tonkatsu by using pork cutlets instead of chicken.</p>
    <p>Serve with white rice and tonkatsu sauce.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded to Â½-inch thickness</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1 cup oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Place flour, beaten egg, and panko crumbs into separate shallow dishes.</li>
        <li>Coat chicken breasts in flour, shaking off any excess; dip into egg, and then press into panko crumbs until well coated on both sides.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the hot oil, and fry until golden brown, 3 or 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
